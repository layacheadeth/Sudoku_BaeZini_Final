#Sudoku Generator and solver game 
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinational number-placement puzzle. 
The objective is to fill a 9 and 9 grid with digits so that each column, each 
row, and each of the nine 3 and 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of
the digits from 1 to 9. 

We will be building the Sudoku game in python using Pygame library and 
automate the game solution recursively using backtracking algorithm.
